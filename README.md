### Create a new Vote

    http POST 0.0.0.0:9000/vote/1

This will return the vote id and the math question:

    {
        "id": 7, 
        "question": "What's 13+3?"
    }

Now to confirm your vote... answer the question by POSTing to /vote/confirm/:id/:answer.

    http POST 0.0.0.0:9000/vote/confirm/7/16

If your math is correct, the vote will be confirmed.

    {
        "message": "Thanks for voting!"
    }

### Get number of votes
